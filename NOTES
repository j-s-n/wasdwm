TODO next release:
	add icons and a system tray
	consider providing the option to merge the client and tag bars
	add the ability to restart without restarting X
	provide better comments
	fix variable names left over from dwm - no more 'bh', 'ty', etc., it's 2014
	
TODO consider:
	should we adjust the box drawing behavior for the tag bar? it's not quite consistent with the client bar
	consider improving the way tags are handled when the number of monitors is reduced
	get rid of as many global variables as possible
	investigate the security of strncpy
	make a rule for marking clients, rethink rules in general

TODO bugs:
	my compositing manager (compton) sometimes fails - investigate
	there's probably a bug or two left over from dwm when it comes to multi-monitor support - I haven't been able to reproduce anything, however
